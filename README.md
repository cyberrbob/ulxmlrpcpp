ulxmlrpcpp
==========

ulxmlrpcpp is intended to be a ultra lightweight xml-rpc library written in C++. It aims to be fully compliant with the XML-RPC standard but still be as lightweight and easy to use as possible.

Unfortunately, the latest version is 1.7.5 released four years ago and there maybe some bugs need to be fixed. So, I created this repo to continue to maintain it with long-term valuable.
